# starman_game

The program is going to be a guessing game, called Starman. In this single-player, text-based game, there is a word which the player needs to guess. 

For each turn of the game, the player guesses a single letter. If that letter is correct, then the guessed letters are displayed in the correct places in the word. 

If that letter is incorrect, then the user loses a star. 

Once the user has no stars left, they have lost the game. However if the user guesses all the letters in the word, they have won the game.
